**Urban Design**
Designing an square for a city is an important task, because the square had been used in many different ways througout history. Sometimes it was used for selling goods, sometimes it was a religious place, and recently many of its classic uses are implemented on the structure.
Urban elements consist of any volume or geometric feature than can be used in a decorative way in a structure or a building.
