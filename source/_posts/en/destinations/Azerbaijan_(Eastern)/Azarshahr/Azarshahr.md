## **Introduction:**

Azarshahr (Tufarqan or Dekhvareqan) is one of the cities of East Azerbaijan province and the center of Azarshahr county. Having Sahand mountain to its east has given a pleasant climate to this city.

The old name of this city was Dehkhareqan, which has been changed to Azarshahr during the Pahlavi dynasty. This city is 1468 meters above sea level. Azarshahr is located 54 kilometers southwest of Tabriz on Tabriz-Bonab axis.
