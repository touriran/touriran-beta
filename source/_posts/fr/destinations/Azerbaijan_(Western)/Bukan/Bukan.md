Bukan is considered to be the second city in Iran, after Karaj, to be the host destination for immigrations from other parts of Iran; especially from its northern and western regions of it, many people have come to call Bukan, home. Bukan is the largest city at south of West Azerbaijan province and it is the center of Bukan county. This city has been granted the title, “Bride of Iran’s cities”.
