## **Introduction:**

Nir is the center of Nir county and one of the cities of Ardabil province. This city is located 31 kilometer from Ardabil city, 20 kilometers from Sarein city and 90 kilometers from Mianeh city. The highway connecting Nir to Ardabil is the cause of its importance. Ancient and historical monuments, being situated on the transit road between Ardabil and East Azerbaijan provinces and being in close proximity with centers of these provinces and also the closeness of the recreational and tourist areas of the county to each other have created an excellent potential and opportunity for growth in the service and tourism department.
