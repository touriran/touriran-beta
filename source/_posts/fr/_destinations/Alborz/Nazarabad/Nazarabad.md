## **Introduction:**

Nazarabad is a county in Alborz  province, located near the Savojbolagh county.  The center of this county is Nazarabad city. The establishment of this city next to the Tehran-Qazvin highway and transit road and Tehran-Tabriz railroad, has been the cause of its development in the past 50 years. Nazarabad plain is located to the south of middle Alborz heights, and due to sedimentation which has taken place during thousands of years, many a remnant are buried in its heart. This plain is one of the virginal places for archeology in pre-historic, post-historic and Islamic era studies.
