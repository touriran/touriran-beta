# **Introduction:**

It is in the centre of the country, and its administrative center is the city of Yazd. The population of Yazd is predominantly Persian, most of whom are Shi'a Muslims. There are also small Zoroastrian communities. The city of Yazdâ€™s first mention in historic records predate it back to around 3000 years B.C. The province has an area of 131,575 km.Yazd was visited by Marco Polo in 1272 A.D, who described it as a good and noble city and remarked its silk production industry. Isolated from any approach by a huge tract of monotonous desert, the vibrancy of Yazd often comes as a surprise.
