# **Introduction:**

This spa is where the eye catching climax of Damavand exists and it has several springs. This place is the most famous spa of Larijan which is called “Shah Abbasi Bath” which is undoubtedly natural, though it is not much clean as it is always crowed.
After Shah Abbasi bath, Ab-Ahan (Water-iron) pool is the most famous pool of the district. There is a high amount of iron in the water of this spring which is obvious from its color! This water is very beneficial for skin diseases and it is located on the top of the mountain.
