# **Introduction:**

The ruins of Foroud citadel is located on the northwest of the city of Kalat and about 1 km north of the village of Ghor over mountains overlooking the Turkmen plains. From this citadel remains remnants of disorganized architecture, among which are signs of water cemetery lined with wavy and foundations of stone walls. Spreading pottery on the surface of this hill is back before Islam and is similar to the Sassanid temples.
